# IIE3692_ course project PUC 2020-1

This repository contains the datasets, codes, and results for the IEE3692 course project (2020-1).

This project improves the results of the Novel Contextual Reference experiment in the gSCAN paper.

I modify the dataset by adding new examples that have grammatically incorrect instructions to improve the results. I also use curriculum learning. I do not modify the model architecture.

Results in the Novel Contextual Reference experiment improve exact match accuracy from 43.18% to 67.10%.
